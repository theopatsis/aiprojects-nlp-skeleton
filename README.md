## Overview
ML model that classifies sincere and insincere Quora entries using GloVe embeddings and Pytorch RNNs. Achieved a 95% accuracy despite our skewed dataset of 1.3 million entries by examining the confusion matrix and using a clever way of upsampling the data for insincere entries. The project was made as part of  the ACM AI Projects Track in Winter 2023.
